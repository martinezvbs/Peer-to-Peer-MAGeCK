# Principal Component Analysis
```{r warning=FALSE}

# First, we need to extract just the numeric count data

 dplyr::select(-sgRNA, -Gene) %>%  # Remove the guide RNA names and gene columns
 as.matrix()                       # Convert from data frame to numeric matrix
# This gives us a matrix with each row = one sgRNA and each column = one sample

# Step 2: Apply log2 transformation to make the data more suitable for PCA
# Why log2 transform?
# - CRISPR count data spans many orders of magnitude (from 0 to millions)
# - Log transformation makes the distribution more even
# - It reduces the impact of extremely high counts
log2_matrix <- log2(count_matrix + 1)  # We add 1 before taking log2 to handle zeros
                                     # (log2(0) is undefined, but log2(1) = 0)

# Step 3: Perform Principal Component Analysis
# PCA finds the main patterns of variation in our data
pca_result <- prcomp(t(log2_matrix), scale. = FALSE)
# We use transpose (t) because we want to analyze relationships between samples
# not between sgRNAs. This makes columns=sgRNAs and rows=samples
# scale=FALSE because we already transformed our data with log2

# Step 4: Extract PCA results and prepare for plotting
pca_df <- as.data.frame(pca_result$x)  # Extract the principal components

# Add sample identifiers and grouping information
pca_df$Sample <- colnames(count_matrix)  # Add sample names from our original data

# Add Day information (D0 or D21) based on sample names
pca_df$Day <- c(rep("D0", 2),           # First 2 samples are Day 0 controls
              rep("D21", 7))           # Remaining 7 samples are Day 21

# Group samples by experimental condition

               rep("In Vivo", 5))      # Last 5 are in vivo xenograft samples

# Step 5: Define color scheme for different sample types
# Using consistent colors helps visually identify sample groups
pca_colors <- c(
 "In Vitro" = "#4b4380",   # Purple for in vitro samples

# What to look for in your PCA plot:
# - Points with different shapes represent different time points:
#   * Circles (shape 21) = Day 0 samples
#   * Squares (shape 22) = Day 21 samples
# - Fill colors represent different growth conditions:
#   * Purple fill = In Vitro samples
#   * Blue fill = In Vivo (xenograft) samples
# - Samples that cluster together are more similar in their sgRNA distributions
# - This dual encoding (shape + color) helps visualize both time and condition effects

# What to look for in this combined visualization:
# - Day 0 to Day 21 changes: Overall shifts in sgRNA abundance over time
# - In Vitro vs In Vivo differences: How growth environment affects sgRNA selection
# - Consistency: How well replicates (R1/R2) match within each condition
# - Outliers: sgRNAs with unusual patterns may represent genes with strong phenotypes
# - Selection intensity: Steeper lines indicate stronger selection pressures
# - Point density: Where most sgRNAs cluster at each timepoint/condition
# - Xenograft heterogeneity: Variation across the five xenograft samples

# A volcano plot shows:
#  - X-axis: Log2 fold change (how much a gene's knockout affects growth)
#  - Y-axis: Statistical significance (-log10 of p-value)
#
# NEGATIVE SELECTION (left panel):
#  - Points in upper left: Genes that reduce growth when knocked out
#  - These are essential genes (their absence hurts cell/tumor growth)
#
# POSITIVE SELECTION (right panel):
#  - Points in upper right: Genes that increase growth when knocked out
#  - These are growth suppressors (their presence limits growth)
#
# The coloring shows:
#  - Grey: Non-significant changes
#  - Blue: Significant by p-value only
#  - Orange: Significant by both p-value and FDR (more reliable)
#  - Red: MEN1 gene (highlighted as the key finding)
#
# For the direct comparison:
#  - MEN1 appears in positive selection, meaning its knockout
#    promotes tumor growth in vivo but not in vitro
#  - This indicates MEN1's unique role in tumor-microenvironment
#    interactions, which is the paper's main finding
