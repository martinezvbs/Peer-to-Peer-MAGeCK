# Peer-to-Peer-MAGeCK
Welcome to the [Peer-to-Peer Teaching Spring Season 2025](https://schedule.yale.edu/calendar/medical-workshops?cid=5105&t=d&d=0000-00-00&cal=5105&inc=0). These sessions are taught by your colleagues to fill our knowledge gaps and keep up with the accelerated pace at which bioinformatics grows as well as other data analysis methodologies. 

This session is dedicated to CRISPR data analysis, and will be led by our colleague [Juan Martinez Villalobos](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/juan-martinezvillalobos/) who is a postgraduate associate in [the Augert Lab](https://www.augertlab.org/) at the Department of Pathology.

## Summary
CRISPR screening is a powerful technique that allows researchers to systematically study gene function across entire genomes. Whether you are new to CRISPR screens or looking to strengthen your analysis skills, this workshop will guide you through the essentials of CRISPR screen analysis. We will break down complex analysis workflows into manageable steps and introduce you to MAGeCKFlute, a popular analysis pipeline used by many researchers in the field.

This session will guide you through:
- Understanding the fundamentals of CRISPR screens and why they are important
- Learning step-by-step analysis workflows that you can apply to your own research
- Getting hands-on experience with the MAGeCK pipeline
- Practicing data analysis with real CRISPR screening datasets
- Learning best practices for documenting your analysis

## Prerequisites
The workshop is designed to be accessible to beginners in CRISPR screening analysis. While all are welcome to attend, having intermediate R programming skills will help you get the most out of the hands-on portions of the workshop. We'll work together through practical examples, ensuring you understand each step of the analysis process.

## Paper
We will be discussing the following paper during the session:
_In vivo CRISPR screens identify a dual function of MEN1 in regulating tumor–microenvironment interactions_
Nat Genet 56, 1890–1902 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-024-01874-9
