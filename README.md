# Peer-to-Peer-MAGeCK
Welcome to the [Peer-to-Peer Teaching Spring Season 2025](https://schedule.yale.edu/calendar/medical-workshops?cid=5105&t=d&d=0000-00-00&cal=5105&inc=0). These sessions are taught by your colleagues to fill our knowledge gaps and keep up with the accelerated pace at which bioinformatics grows as well as other data analysis methodologies. 

This session is dedicated to CRISPR data analysis, and will be led by our colleague [Juan Martinez Villalobos](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/juan-martinezvillalobos/) who is a postgraduate associate in [the Augert Lab](https://www.augertlab.org/) at the Department of Pathology.
